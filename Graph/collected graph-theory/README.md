# Graph Theory Algorithms

### What you may learn here?
Graph theory is a very important topic for competitive programmers. For mastering problem solving skill, one need to learn a couple of graph theory algorithms, most of them are classical. Giant companies like google, facebook or others, where searching is needed, they need to conduct with graph theory. Here, I just wrote code of different popular graph theory algorithms. If you want to know theoretical details or pseudo-code you may love to visit [Shafayet Vai's Blog](http://www.shafaetsplanet.com/planetcoding/) .You should/must read CLRS book [Introduction to Algorithm](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844) for brushing up detailed knowledge on algorithms.

*Language: C++*

*Books Followd: Introduction to Algorithm by CLRS*

### Short Message
- In Algorithms Book Like Introduction to Algorithm by CLRS they just explained about the algorithm, how it works, it's pseudo code, space complexity or time complexity. They didn't code any algorithm cause it's your task to code following pseudo code when you know how an algorithm works. But sometimes it gets harder for a self-learner to code without getting help from others. So, if you are a self-learner these staffs may help you.
- I have tested this codes several times. I think these codes are bug-free! If you find anything wrong feel free to let me know.
